# **Exercises â€“ String Formatting Challenge**

In these exercises you will create a Personal Information Formatter application. You will practice string concatenation techniques and use Math class methods to format numerical data in different ways.

Remember to create your projects in the pluralsight/workbook-1 folder.

## **EXERCISE 2**

Create a Java application named PersonalInfoFormatter. This application will take personal information stored in variables and format it into multiple professional output strings using various concatenation techniques.

**Remember:** When creating a new Java project, create a new git repository and commit your changes often! Don't forget to push to github.com. Always create the Github repository before creating a new Java project.

**Requirements:**
- Create variables for: firstName = "Sarah", lastName = "Johnson", age = 28, annualSalary = 67543.789

- Create at least 4 different formatted output strings using various string concatenation approaches
- Display a formal introduction, a brief summary, a financial overview, and a custom formatted message
- Demonstrate different concatenation techniques (+ operator, multiple operations, etc.)

# **Exercises â€“ Geometry Calculator**

In these exercises you will create a Geometry Calculator application. You will work with Math class methods to calculate areas and perimeters of different shapes while practicing arithmetic operators and complex mathematical formulas.

Remember to create your projects in the pluralsight/workbook-1 folder.

---

## **EXERCISE 3**

Create a Java application named GeometryCalculator. This application will calculate area and perimeter for multiple geometric shapes using Math class methods and demonstrate complex formula calculations.

**Remember:** When creating a new Java project, create a new git repository and commit your changes often! Don't forget to push to github.com. Always create the Github repository before creating a new Java project.

**Requirements:**
- Create variables for: circleRadius = 5.5, rectangleLength = 8.2, rectangleWidth = 3.7, triangleBase = 6.0, triangleHeight = 4.5
- Calculate circle area using Math.PI and Math.pow() for radius squared
- Calculate circle circumference using Math.PI
- Calculate rectangle area and perimeter using basic operators
- Calculate triangle area and use Math.sqrt() to find the hypotenuse (assuming right triangle)
- Format all results using appropriate Math class rounding methods
- Use string concatenation to create professional output displaying all calculations

**Expected Output Example:**
```
=== Geometry Calculator ===

Circle (radius: 7.2):
Area: 162.86 square units
Circumference: 45.24 units

Rectangle (12.5 x 4.8):
Area: 60.00 square units  
Perimeter: 34.60 units

Right Triangle (base: 9.0, height: 6.5):
Area: 29.25 square units
Hypotenuse: 11.14 units

=== Summary ===
Total area calculated: 252.11 square units
